*`Developer & Artist`*

Hello! I'm Sunny, or Cal, whichever you prefer. I'm a self-taught developer currently learning Python with some experience in HTML and CSS. Programming makes me feel proud of what I can achieve. I enjoy looking back at past projects to see how much I've accomplished. I love making open-source projects to share my creations with others. Graphic design also brings me joy, as it allows me to express my thoughts and ideas visually.
